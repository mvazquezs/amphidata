\title{Quick configuration and customization of ggplot2 themes}
\usage{
theme_ggplot(
  font_family = "Arial",
  aspect_ratio = NULL,
  legend_position = c("bottom", "right", "none"),
  base_theme = c("linedraw", "gray", "classic", "bw", "minimal", "light")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{font_family}{Main font family to use for all plot text.
Default: \code{'Arial'}}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Aspect ratio (width/height) of the plot panel.
Use a numeric value (e.g., 1 for a square). Default: \code{NULL}.}

\item{legend_position}{Position of the legend. Can be \code{'bottom'}, \code{'right'}, or \code{'none'}.
Default: \code{'bottom'}.}

\item{base_theme}{Base ggplot2 theme to use. Options: \code{'linedraw'}, \code{'gray'},
\code{'classic'}, \code{'bw'}, \code{'minimal'}, \code{'light'}. Default: \code{'linedraw'}.}
}
\value{
A \code{theme} object, which can be added to a ggplot with \code{+}.
}
\description{
Applies a custom theme configuration to a ggplot2 object, allowing
a choice between several base themes (\code{theme_linedraw}, \code{theme_bw}, etc.) and
applying uniform formatting adjustments (typography, titles, X-axis text)
to maintain visual consistency.
}
\details{
The function is designed to reduce redundancy in customizing
ggplot2 plots. All common customization options
(such as font, size, and title alignment) are applied
consistently regardless of the chosen base theme. The 'bw' theme
has specific adjustments for grid cleaning and slightly different text sizes.
It returns an object of class 'theme' that should be added to the plot with the \code{+} sign.

\examples{
\dontrun{
library(ggplot2)
# Create a base plot
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = 'Example Plot')

# Apply the 'bw' theme with legend on the right
p + theme_ggplot(base_theme = 'bw', legend_position = 'right')

# Apply the 'minimal' theme with a square aspect ratio
p + theme_ggplot(base_theme = 'minimal', aspect_ratio = 1)
}
